Ask someone in the building trades how they feel about taking jobs where:

* well-meaning homeowners have tried to save money by doing their own work, and are now calling in a professional
* there has been previous work done by a less-than-reputable contractor who took shortcuts
* the house has infrastructure that was "grandfathered" in without having to adhere to modern regulations

Often a good contractor won't bid on these jobs at all, because of risk.  If they do take a job, there will be a caviat that the price may change, depending on what they find.

As a contract software developer, I keep finding myself in the following situations:

* I'm asked to provide a quote for a firm fixed price contract, based on almost no information
* I'm working on systems built by someone who was obviously unfamiliar with stadard architectural principles 
*
