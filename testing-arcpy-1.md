# Testing with ArcPy

[Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Limitations) has been a major part of the discipline of software engineering for almost two decades; a [Red-Green-Refactor](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html) cycle helps keep codebases maintainable, while lowering the risk of adding new features by protecting against regression and facilitating extensible designs.

The design and history of [arcpy](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) and its related modules can make it difficult to test, and testing and automation are not always given high priority in GIS projects.  Nevertheless, there are techniques to help ease the process, and it's relatively easy to test drive the development of GIS software.

This post walks through a couple of simple test scenarios, and the full project is available on [github](https://github.com/lobsteropteryx/testing-arcpy).

## Geodatabase Operations

A common task that can be automated via arcpy is transforming geodatabase data and schemas.  We may want to use [FieldMappings](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/classes/fieldmappings.htm), add or remove fields, and calculate new values derived from existing fields; all of these operations can be test-driven.

In this example, we'll test-drive a very simple feature:  Adding a new field, and populating it with the sum of two other fields.

## Test Fixture

While arcpy exposes methods to create a new feature class and insert records, this can become difficult to maintain for large numbers of tables with many fields.  Another approach is to use a [fixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture#Software).

Our fixture will be a simpple file geocodatabase (FGDB); this database will hold known data that will be used by our tests.  Since a FGDB is just a directory, we can check it into our project and manage it just like any other test files.

When creating a test fixture, we want to use the minimum set of data needed to prove out our logic; in practice, this usually means tables with one or two rows--we'll be running the tests many, many times, so we want them to be as fast as possible!

Note:  ArcMap may lock the database if we have it open; because of this, it's a good idea to add `.lock` files in the test data directory to your `.gitignore` file.

Because we need a FGDB to hold our fixture data, the tests are not true unit tests, since they're still coupled to the filesystem.  We can keep this coupling as loose as possible, by copying the fixture data into an in-memory workspace before each test.

Once we have our fixture created, our project structure should look something like this:

```bash
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── my_module.py
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── fixtures
    │   └── test_data.gdb
    │       ├── <a whole bunch of FGDB files>
    └── test_my_module.py
```

## Setting up and tearing down

We want each test to run from a fresh, clean state, and to be independent of all the other tests.  We can accomplish this by copying our fixture data into memory, and cleaning up in the `tearDown` method of the python [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) module; this method will automatically be run after each test.

The [Copy](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/copy.htm) tool [doesn't support](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/tool-errors-and-warnings/001001-010000/tool-errors-and-warnings-00251-00275-000260.htm) `in_memory` workspaces, but we can use a create and append pattern, with a template:

```python
import os
import unittest
import arcpy


class MyModuleTest(unittest.TestCase):

    TEST_GDB = 'in_memory'

    def setup_data(self, table_name='MyTable'):
        input_file = os.path.abspath('tests/fixtures/test_data.gdb/{}'.format(table_name))
        output_file = '{}/{}'.format(self.TEST_GDB, table_name)
        arcpy.CreateFeatureclass_management(
            out_path=self.TEST_GDB,
            out_name=table_name,
            template=input_file
        )
        arcpy.Append_management(
            inputs=input_file,
            target=output_file,
            schema_type='NO_TEST'
        )
        return output_file
```

To clean up, we call the [Delete](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/delete.htm) tool in our `tearDown` method:

```python
    def tearDown(self):
        arcpy.Delete_management(self.TEST_GDB)
```

Now we're ready to write our first test!

## Adding a Field

Say we want our business code to add a `SUM` field to the table, and calculate some value.  We'll write our test first:

```python
def test adds_sum_field(self):
    feature_class = self.setup_data('SumData')
    field_name = 'SUM'
    add_sum_field(feature_class)
    field_names = [field.name for field in arcpy.ListFields(feature_class)]
    self.assertTrue(field_name in field_names)
```

and watch it fail:

```shell
$ pytest
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-3.1.2, py-1.4.34, pluggy-0.4.0
rootdir: C:\develop\testing-arcpy, inifile:
collected 1 items

tests\test_my_module.py F

================================== FAILURES ===================================
______________________ MyModuleTest.test_adds_sum_field _______________________

self = <tests.test_my_module.MyModuleTest testMethod=test_adds_sum_field>

    def test_adds_sum_field(self):
        feature_class = self.setup_data('SumData')
        field_name = 'SUM'
        field_names = [field.name for field in arcpy.ListFields(feature_class)]
>       self.assertTrue(field_name in field_names)
E       AssertionError: False is not true

tests\test_my_module.py:32: AssertionError
========================== 1 failed in 11.63 seconds ==========================
```

Next we add our implementation code to the business module:

```python
import arcpy


def add_sum_field(feature_class):
    arcpy.AddField_management(
        in_table=feature_class,
        field_name='SUM',
        field_type='DOUBLE'
    )
```

And rerun our tests:

```shell
$ pytest
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-3.1.2, py-1.4.34, pluggy-0.4.0
rootdir: C:\develop\testing-arcpy, inifile:
collected 1 items

tests\test_my_module.py .

========================== 1 passed in 11.61 seconds ==========================
```

## Calculating a Field Value

Now we want to add some logic to calculate our `SUM` value; again, we'll write the test first:

```python
    def test_calculates_sum(self):
        feature_class = self.setup_data('SumData')
        add_sum_field(feature_class)
        with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(feature_class, ['SUM']) as cursor:
            for row in cursor:
                self.assertEqual(row[0], 2)
```

and watch it fail:

```shell
$ pytest
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-3.1.2, py-1.4.34, pluggy-0.4.0
rootdir: C:\develop\testing-arcpy, inifile:
collected 2 items

tests\test_my_module.py .F

================================== FAILURES ===================================
______________________ MyModuleTest.test_calculates_sum _______________________

self = <tests.test_my_module.MyModuleTest testMethod=test_calculates_sum>

    def test_calculates_sum(self):
        feature_class = self.setup_data('SumData')
        add_sum_field(feature_class)
        with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(feature_class, ['SUM']) as cursor:
            for row in cursor:
>               self.assertEqual(row[0], 2)
E               AssertionError: None != 2

tests\test_my_module.py:42: AssertionError
===================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 12.76 seconds =====================
```

then implement our business logic:

```python
import arcpy


def add_sum_field(feature_class):
    arcpy.AddField_management(
        in_table=feature_class,
        field_name='SUM',
        field_type='DOUBLE'
    )

    fields = ['FIRST_VALUE', 'SECOND_VALUE', 'SUM'] 
    with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(feature_class, fields) as cursor:
        for row in cursor:
            row[2] = row[0] + row[1]
            cursor.updateRow(row)
```

And check that our tests pass:

```shell
$ pytest
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-3.1.2, py-1.4.34, pluggy-0.4.0
rootdir: C:\develop\testing-arcpy, inifile:
collected 2 items

tests\test_my_module.py ..

========================== 2 passed in 13.22 seconds ==========================
```

Once everything is green, we take a moment to look for places to remove duplication, make our intent clear, and just clean up our code.  This is the refactor step, and it is **critical!**

Looking at our above code, we might separate out setting the new field value into its own function:

```python
import arcpy


def add_sum_field(feature_class):
    arcpy.AddField_management(
        in_table=feature_class,
        field_name='SUM',
        field_type='DOUBLE'
    )
    _update_sum_value

def _update_sum_value(feature_class):
    fields = ['FIRST_VALUE', 'SECOND_VALUE', 'SUM'] 
    with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(feature_class, fields) as cursor:
        for row in cursor:
            row[2] = row[0] + row[1]
            cursor.updateRow(row)
```

and make sure our tests are still green:

```shell
$ pytest
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-3.1.2, py-1.4.34, pluggy-0.4.0
rootdir: C:\develop\testing-arcpy, inifile:
collected 2 items

tests\test_my_module.py ..

========================== 2 passed in 13.23 seconds ==========================
```

Having tests lets us make changes to keep our code neat and maintainable, while giving confidence that we haven't changed the fundamental behavior; it also protects against regression when new features are added, or requirements change in the future.  Once you fall into the rhythm of red-green-refactor, it's both gratifying and surprising to see how quickly you can add new features to a project!
